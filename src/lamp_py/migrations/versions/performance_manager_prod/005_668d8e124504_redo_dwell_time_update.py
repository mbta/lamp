"""redo_dwell_time_update

Revision ID: 668d8e124504
Revises: 896dedd8a4db
Create Date: 2024-07-16 06:35:01.675273

This change simplifies dwell_time calculations to not perform dwell time calculations
for stations at the start or end of a trip

Details
* upgrade -> iterate through service_date/static_version_key combos and update dwell_time

* downgrade -> Nothing
