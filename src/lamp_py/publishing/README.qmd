LAMP's metastore (data catalog?) provides users the experience of querying a relational database without requiring all the overhead that databases require (for the LAMP and Infra teams 🙂).
That means a query that used to look like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM read_parquet('s3://mbta-ctd-dataplatform-springboard/lamp/BUS_VEHICLE_POSITIONS/year=2025/month=9/day=26/2025-09-26T00:00:00.parquet')
LIMIT 10
```

Now can be written as:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM lamp.BUS_VEHICLE_POSITIONS
WHERE year = 2025
AND month = 9
AND day = 26
LIMIT 10
```

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

First, choose an interface for DuckDB.
If this is your first time using DuckDB, stick with the built-in UI:

1. Install DuckDB using [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/duckdb#default) (for macOS) or [winget](https://winstall.app/apps/DuckDB.cli) (for PowerShell)
2. Execute `export ui_disable_server_certificate_verification=1` (for macOS) or `$env:ui_disable_server_certificate_verification=1` (in PowerShell). This tells your computer to trust DuckDB's UI.
3. Restart your terminal
4. Execute `duckdb -ui`; `http://localhost:4213/` should open with a notebook interface

Some other DuckDB interfaces that stand out:

* [marimo](https://marimo.io/) for a shiny notebook experience
* [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) if you want the feel of an old SQL editor

(This document is rendered by R's `duckdb` library and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), which provides options for different outputs like websites, presentations, and PDFs.)

Then, [create an AWS access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-key-self-managed.html#Using_CreateAccessKey) (against Amazon's advice).
If you can install `awscli` using [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/awscli#default) or [winget](https://winstall.app/apps/Amazon.AWSCLI), [persist your access key using it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/reference/configure/#examples); if you can't install it, you'll need to enter your access key each time you open DuckDB.

```{r}
#| include: false
lamp <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())
```

```{sql}
#| include: false
#| connection: lamp
INSTALL httpfs;
INSTALL icu;
```

### Attaching the catalog

To access the s3 buckets that hold LAMP data, open a DuckDB session and perform the following steps:

1. Install the `aws` extension.
```{sql}
#| connection: lamp
INSTALL aws;
```

2. **Load your AWS credentials each time you start a DuckDB session**. If you've persisted them with `awscli`, run
```{sql}
#| connection: lamp
LOAD aws;
CREATE OR REPLACE SECRET secret (
    TYPE s3,
    PROVIDER credential_chain
);
```

If you haven't, insert your credentials in this command:
```sql
LOAD aws;
CREATE SECRET (
    TYPE s3,
    KEY_ID [ID],
    SECRET [Secret],
    REGION 'us-east-1'
);
```

3. Attach the Lightswitch data catalog. This is a
DuckDB database that only holds views of LAMP Parquet URIs. For
instance, the view for `RT_VEHICLE_POSITIONS` contains logic that lists
the URLs for each `RT_VEHICLE_POSITIONS` file in LAMP’s springboard
bucket.
```{sql}
#| connection: lamp
ATTACH 's3://mbta-ctd-dataplatform-staging-archive/lamp/catalog.db' AS lamp
```

And that's it!
You're all set up.

## Querying

Get familiar with what's available by listing the database's views:

```{sql}
#| connection: lamp
SHOW TABLES FROM lamp
```

GTFS-RT data is partitioned by `year`, `month`, and `day` and filtering the view by the partition is key to performance.
Let's take `rt_vehicle_positions` for instance.

```{sql}
#| connection: lamp
DESCRIBE lamp.rt_vehicle_positions
```

To query this view, apply a filter on `year`, `month`, and `day`:

```{sql}
#| connection: lamp
SELECT *
FROM lamp.rt_vehicle_positions
WHERE year = 2025
AND month = 10
AND day BETWEEN 1 AND 9
```

⚠️ Unfortunately, DuckDB doesn't recognize `year`, `month`, and `day` as composing a date, so this query won't work:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM lamp.rt_vehicle_positions
WHERE file_date BETWEEN '2025-10-01' and '2025-10-09'
```

In addition, the native syntax is rather slow.
To more efficiently query year-month-day partitioned datasets such as `rt_vehicle_positions`, use the function `lamp.read_ymd`, which accepts start and end dates.

```{sql}
#| connection: lamp
SELECT *
FROM lamp.read_ymd(
    "RT_VEHICLE_POSITIONS", -- case sensitive
    DATE '2025-10-01',
    DATE '2025-10-10' -- end date is not inclusive
)
LIMIT 10
```
